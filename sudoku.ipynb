    "## Getting Started\n",
    "This jupyter notebook presents an agent that can solve sudoku puzzles. A 9x9 grid is given with some fixed values. To solve the puzzle, the objective is to fill the empty cells of the grid such that the numbers 1 to 9 appear exactly once in each row, column, and 3x3 block of the grid. \n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a sample puzzle along with its solution. \n",

    "<img src=\"images/sudoku.png\" style=\"width: 50%;\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Choice of Algorithm\n",
    "The choice of different algorithms to solve sudoku puzzles is explained the read me file and implemented in cells below, all approaches consider *data structures*, as tesult of certain algorithms will work much faster with certain data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sample Sudoku Puzzles\n",
    "To get started, the cell below will load in some sample sudoku puzzles for you so you can see the format. There are sudokus provided of multiple difficulties (easier sudokus typically start with more digits provided). The cell below only loads the easiest, but there is another test cell lower in the notebook which will run your code against all of the provided puzzles.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each sudoku is a 9x9 NumPy array of integers, where zero represents an empty square. Each difficulty comes with 15 sudokus, so when you load the file, it is stored in a 15x9x9 array."
